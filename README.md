# R_Project
This project is part of Machine Learning. I have implemented supervised learninig here. There are sevreal techniques for implementing problem but here our variable diseal price is continuous, so I have implemented Linear Regration.
I was not satisfacted by the accuracy of the linear model so I used polynomial regration on the same problem. I got higher accuracy then linear.
